      "answer": "Cloud deployment essential for test reports. Local deployment advanced using quantization. BeagleBone AI-64 has 4GB RAM but system takes 1-1.5GB.",

      "answer": "RAG good for up-to-date info but fine-tuning better for domain understanding. Use 'fine-tuning with retrieval' - quality dataset + RAG for latest context.",
